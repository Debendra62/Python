	a. Use rename function or any logic you can create by your own?
	b. Change Revenue (Millions) to Revenue
	c. Change Runtime (Minutes) to Runtime

2. Change column names to Lower case [Take "code reference" from yesterday's code if you have confusion]

3. Check and Fill NA values of both revenue and metascore columns with appropriate values (use mean, median, or drop it)

4. Create a function name called "check_revenue" and pass dataframe "revenue data" i.e. df["revenue"]
 	to it one by one (using apply) and if revenue is more than average (mean) value of df["revenue"] then return 
	"blockbuster" else return "not blockbuster"

5. Add new column named as "performance" and add whether movie is "blockbuster" or "not blockbuster" to it (use output from number 4)

6. Print and Analyze which director gave blockbuster and which did not.

7.  Slicing and indexing:

	c. print first 10 rows and first 3 columns using loc and iloc
